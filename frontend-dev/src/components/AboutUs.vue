        Project Description
        Area38 is a lightweight and AI-based Business Intelligence Analysis Website, which provides commercial entities especially for individual merchants a handy platform where they can obtain business metrics forecasting of their own business based on their historical sales data. Specifically, we expect to provide users with demand curve fitting for optimized pricing strategies, RFM customer segmentation analysis and AI-statistical time-series prediction to help them achieve a higher profit or customized goals.
        With the assistance of our concise and clear business metrics forecasting, we believe that our users will have a fabulous and satisfying experience when they choose to use our website.
        Before action, we had an idea. We exist to create the website that can facilitate businesses to improve their data-driven decision making in a user-friendly way without seeing complex code and numbers. Now, Area38 has grown from a general conception in our requirement analysis, into a sophisticated business analytical website with sound administrative system for all users. This burgeoning growth not only comes from the enormous effort we made while designing and implementing this website, but also it largely leans on the atmosphere of mutual trust and tacit cooperation between us.

        Any commercial entities especially for individual merchants
